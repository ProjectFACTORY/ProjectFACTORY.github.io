This is the source code for the project FACTORY  [https://projectfactory.github.io/](https://projectfactory.github.io/)

#### Structure 
The complete site's content is based on a json/xml file per section (e.g., ```contact.json```, ```projects.json```, ```publications.json```, ```talks.json```, and ```teaching.json```) as well as the pages ```_config.yml``` information. 


* Each section has is own file in the root folder.
* *_includes/* contains the html + liquid snippets that will fill the pages of the site.

* *_data/* contains the .json files with some content (publications, contact information, team members...) to be read by, e.g., the snippets in _includes/

* *_layouts*: layouts are to be used from the different pages. A layout says what goes before and after a page content (e.g.: headers, footers, navigation bars...)

* *_site*: public site generated by Github after processing the jekyll instructions (e.g.: liquid tags).

A page in the root, for instance, uses a layout from *_layouts* and generates some content. The content can be generated using the snippets in *_includes/*

If a page in the root has extension .md, markdown content will be parsed into html and the final page will have the .html extension.

The publications page needs to be manually generated since Github does noto support the jekyll-scholar plugin. A possible alternative is to this plugin locally and then add
the resulting page in your site.

To edit things online, just edit a file and commit. Github will re-generate the *_site* folder and the site will be updated.
