# For final users
In this section we cover the typical use cases:

## Add a team member

Just add the member information in the `/data/members.yaml` file.

	- name: a name 
	  status: principal | advisor | postdoc | phd | whatever
	  position: a position title
	  homepage: http://www.membersite.net
	  googlescholar: "https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=myuser123"
	  orchid:  0000-0001-1234-5678
	  github:  a github username
	  twitter: a twitter username
	  email:   a valid email 
	  photo:   a filename to be found in /img/

If status is `advisor` the member will be placed in the advisors section. All the other members are presented respecting the order in `members.yaml`.`name`, `status`, `position`, and `email` are mandatory fields.

## Update the publications list

You can just copy paste the output of your JabRef and name it `publications.html` 
However, it will appear as a stand-alone page without the menu and the style of the site. In order to fix this, add `{% include head.html %}` to the header section of your file:

	<head>
	{% include head.html %}		
	<title>JabRef References output</title>
	... the rest of the file...



## Add some openings 

Openings are hard coded in the `index.md`. Just add a new html line (see the `<li>` lines) with references or anything you need:


	<section id="openings" class="container" style='padding-top:0rem; margin-top:-2rem;'>
	<div class="row text-xs-center">
	  <div class="col-xs">
	    <h1>openings</h1>
	  </div>
	</div>

	<div class="row flex-items-xs-center text-xs-justify">
	  <div class="col-md-9">
	     <p class="text-xs-center">
	     <ul>		     
			<li><h5> Open postdoc positions for <a href="http://projectfactory.irit.fr/postdoccall.pdf"> our project </a> </h5></li>
		    <li><h5> Open PhD positions for <a href="http://projectfactory.irit.fr/phdcall.pdf"> our project </a> </h5></li>
		 </ul>
	    </p>
	  </div>
	</div>
	</section>

## Add some news

Just add the information in the `/data/news.yaml` file:

	  - date: 2017-02-28
	    title: Julia won the Nobel Prize
	    description: Our team member Julia Backprop won the Nobel Prize for is work in Deep Quantic Tensor Factorization.
	    downloads :
	      - href: http://www.linknobel.org/juliaquanticnobel.html
		    desc: description of the href


# For developers: Site structure 
The complete site's content is based on a json/xml/yaml file per section (e.g., ```contact.json```, ```projects.json```, ```publications.json```, ```talks.json```, and ```teaching.json```) as well as the pages ```_config.yml``` information. 


* Each section has is own file in the root folder.
* *_includes/* contains the html + liquid snippets that will fill the pages of the site.

* *_data/* contains the .json files with some content (publications, contact information, team members...) to be read by, e.g., the snippets in _includes/

* *_layouts*: layouts are to be used from the different pages. A layout says what goes before and after a page content (e.g.: headers, footers, navigation bars...)

* *_site*: public site generated by Github after processing the jekyll instructions (e.g.: liquid tags).

A page in the root, for instance, uses a layout from *_layouts* and generates some content. The content can be generated using the snippets in *_includes/*

If a page in the root has extension .md, markdown content will be parsed into html and the final page will have the .html extension.

The publications page needs to be manually generated since Github does noto support the jekyll-scholar plugin. A possible alternative is to this plugin locally and then add
the resulting page in your site.

To edit things online, just edit a file and commit. Github will re-generate the *_site* folder and the site will be updated.
